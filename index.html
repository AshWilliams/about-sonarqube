                        <h3>What is <strong>Technical Debt</strong>?</h3>
                        <p>(also known as <strong>design debt</strong> or <strong>code debt</strong>) is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.</p>

                    <p>is an open source platform to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells and security vulnerabilities on 20+ programming languages including Java, C#, JavaScript, C/C++, COBOL and more.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Continuous Inspection</strong></h3>
                        <p>SonarQube provides the capability to not only show health of an application but also to highlight issues newly introduced. With a Quality Gate in place, you can fix the leak and therefore improve code quality systematically.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section style="text-align: left;">
                        <h4><strong>Overall health</strong></h4>
                        <p>Your project home page shows where you stand in terms of quality in a glimpse of an eye. This main page also shows you an immediate sense of the good results achieved over time.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Focus on the Leak</strong></h4>
                        <p>The water leak paradigm is a simple yet powerful way to manage code quality: quality of new - changed and added - code should be put under control before anything else.</p>

                        <p>With SonarQube, a developer has everything at hand to take ownership of the quality of his code. To fully enforce a code quality practice across all teams, you need to set up a Quality Gate.</p>

                        <p>Once you have SonarQube in place, you will quickly want to make sure you add as few issues as possible to your code base.</p>

                        <p>The "Issues" page of your project gives you full power to analyze in detail what the main issues are, where they are located, when they were added to your code base and who originally introduced them.</p>

                        <p>SonarQube treats test coverage and duplications, two of the major software quality problems, as first class citizens. The "Measures" page lets you browse your project in different ways to highlight files that need your attention.</p>

                        <p>Issues raised by SonarQube are on either demonstrably wrong code, or code that is more likely not giving the intended behavior. Examples include null-pointer dereferences, memory leaks, and logic errors.</p>

                        <p>"Smelly" code does (probably) what it should, but it will be difficult to maintain. In the worst cases, it will be so confusing that maintainers can inadvertently introduce bugs.</p>

                        <p>It's probably Pollyanna-ish to think you’ll never be targeted by hackers. When you are, what vulnerabilities will they find in your system? SonarQube helps you find and track the insecurities in your code. Examples include SQL injection, hard-coded passwords and badly managed errors.</p>

                        <p>SonarQube code analyzers include default Quality Profiles that offer strong value with non-controversial rule sets. The default Quality Profiles will work for most projects, but you can easily tune them to fully match your needs.</p>

                        <p>SonarQube relies on several path-sensitive dataflow engines and thus code analyzers explore all possible execution paths to spot the trickiest bugs. Even a simple function containing only 10 different branches might lead to 100 different possible execution paths at runtime.</p>

                        <p>With SonarQube comes a code analyzer for each major programming language. Each analyzer provides numerous rules to spot general and language-specific quality issues.</p>

                        <p>Applications often use several programming languages at once, for example [C#, C++ and JavaScript] or [Java, JavaScript and HTML]. SonarQube automatically detects these languages and invokes the corresponding analyzers.</p>

                        <p>Once an analysis is done, a report is sent to the SonarQube server to be integrated. At the end of this integration, a standard webhook mechanism lets you notify any external system to do whatever you want: trigger an alarm, update a wallboard, notify a chat room.</p>
